    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;m temporarily staying near a state park and have had a lot of opportunity to do my favourite thing&ndash;extended walks in nature where I can go down deep holes I’d typically consider best left to rabbits with pocket watches. Today, my brain apparently decided it was time to formalise and classify different types of nuance (because <em>nothing</em> is more nuanced than a formal classification schema).</p>
<p>I think that one of the most important skills for thinking fairly and accurately is considering nuance: resisting binary dichotomies on complex and important topics. This is tough work and requires a lot of vigilance.</p>
<p>Our brains eat and breathe assumptions and dichotomies, and I make my own in spades. This is probably because they’re by and large useful, and perfectly apt for very simple reasoning we need in order to even get through primary school. Some examples of accurate dichotomies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A medium egg contains ~6g of protein (true) vs. The Illuminati controls the government (false)</li>
<li>Ebola (bad), Puppies (good)</li>
<li>Fedoras are hats. They are not cats</li>
</ul>
<p>But when it comes to high-level, intricate topics (and especially ones that are emotional, political, and/or that relate to identity or values), creating dichotomies often impairs our ability to think reasonably about complex systems and empathise with others. (To another software engineer, I might say this: any algorithm that solves a hard problem is going to involve more than two bits of information.) Hence, the need for nuanced thinking.</p>
<p>I (arbitrarily—an adverb that I add in all humility because I know these are just the idle thoughts of a 23 year old!) broke these dichotomies down into three types based around simple dichotomies I think we throw around a lot: true or false, good or bad, is or is not. I’ll break them down below, along with mental strategies I think are sometimes usefil to combat them.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Dichotomy 1: Truthfulness Dichotomy</p>
<p>The truthfulness dichotomy is when we view a statement completely as either true or false, as objectively correct or objectively incorrect. However, often times our understandings are actually partially true and partially false, or technically true but missing a bigger whole picture. We are limited by our knowledge of facts and our own biases/expectations. Because of the complexity of topics and our inevitable limitations, we often need a more complicated type of belief than binary certainty. Some examples I hear sometimes, or have caught myself using:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that that person is deliberately lying</li>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that the death penalty makes society safer</li>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that COVID-19 is a big threat</li>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that a fruit diet will cure my pancreas cancer</li>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that Trump will win the next election</li>
<li>I believe/don’t believe that America is losing global power</li>
</ul>
<p>When I find myself limited by this way of thinking—which is often, and natural—I’ve found that the best antidote is thinking is shifting to think more probalistically, where I consider my level of confidence in my beliefs, avoid acting/talking as if I have 100% confidence in anything, and determine what sort of evidence I would need to shift my beliefs. (Admitting honest uncertainty is also a great tool to prevent unproductive / overly emotional arguments.)</p>
<p>Here are some potentially useful heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the percentage chance is that this viewpoint is correct? (It’s often not very necassarry to be accurate—I find just asking myself the question and creating rough numbers based on gut feelings helps me.)</li>
<li>Would I be extremely surprised if it turned out I was mistaken on this issue, or only a bit surprised?</li>
<li>Assuming I was wrong, what do I suspect would be the reason? Can I do more research on that?</li>
<li>Would I be willing to bet a lot of money that I’m right? Just a little? None at all?</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>
<p>Dichotomy 2: Goodness Dichotomy</p>
<p>This is the dichotomy nearest to my heart, and fundamental to personal and societal empathy. It is our tendancy to label things as good or bad, positive or negative, moral or immoral - when in fact, in almost all hotly debated topics and policies, there is a mix of good things and bad things (even though you might believe one side is better, all things considered.)</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear power is good/bad</li>
<li>Socialism is good/bad</li>
<li>Capitilaism is good/bad</li>
<li>The USA / China is good/bad</li>
<li>Facial recognitation technology is good/bad</li>
<li>Anti-depressants are good/bad</li>
<li>Religion is good/bad</li>
<li>This book is good/bad</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve mentioned to some people in the past that some of the most morally-behaving people I know tend more often to view goodness as a dichtomoy. Saying “lying is bad” (and therefore I just won’t consider it) creates a lot less temptation to lie as you aren’t weighing out the upsides and downsides of a lie in this particular case and therefore subject to your own mind’s crafty ability to trick and to justify almost anything in order to get what it wants.</p>
<p>But I don’t think it’s any co-oincidence that a lot of these people tend not have the most thoughtful opinions on politics or be the most understanding towards people in general. Thinking in terms of grey makes us more effective at improving policies (because it allows us to better consider tradeoffs and how to mitigate them), and it helps us avoid accidentally harming not just “people” but our loved ones through misguided good intentions.</p>
<p>On a person-to-person level, grey thinking is something that gets harder when I&rsquo;m upset, so it often just means I’m emotional and need to a breather. When it comes to policies, I slip into it all the time. These are some of the questions I ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the pros and cons of this course of action?</li>
<li>Who will benefit from this, and who will get hurt? (And by how much?)</li>
<li>If I imagine I was one of the people advocating for the “bad” side, and I assume I was a generally good, fair, and intelligent person, what could be some reasons why I would I be advocating for that?</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>
<p>Dichotomy 3: Identification Dichotomy
This one is a bit hard to explain, because my mind only wants to use computer science analogies. I’ll instead use my other favourite deep well of trivia—India.</p>
<p>If you look at a world map, you’ll notice a peculiarity about the borders of states in the US, or countries in Africa. Compared to Europe and Asia, these borders are very clean and straight, and you’ve read about the historical reasons—when these places were conquered, the conquerers just drew straight lines on maps rather than following any sort of logical topography or existing cultural/linguistic boundaries. And we can kind of point to that and say it was a necessary precursor the problems in Somalia, Rwanda, and the Indo-Pakistani Partition. Lines were drawn based on assumptions/misunderstandings/limited understanding/greed—and millions paid the price in the form of their lives.</p>
<p>If drawn more carefully, more borders might more naturally look like the one between India and Bangledesh. It is not at all a simple border—there are islands of Indian territory inside islands of Bangladeshi territory inside islands of Indian territory inside of Bangladesh. But it much more accurately reflects the allegiance and the cultural/linguistic background of the people within the borders than just drawing a line right through Punjab.</p>
<p>The identification dichotomy is when we <em>think</em> with straight lines—we define things as either a member of a category or not a member of that category, when in fact, almost every categorization will have edge cases that might lie between categories, or completely fail to categorize other cases, or which are decent categorizations for certain problems and actively harmful for other problems.</p>
<p>(We often then make the <em>further</em> mistake of thinking that just because we use a certain label, that label then by definition implies things about individuals in the group.)</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re with us, or you’re against us</li>
<li>You’re a woman, or you’re a man</li>
<li>That’s a cult, or it’s not a cult</li>
<li>You’re a patriot, or you’re an antinational</li>
<li>You’re gay, or you’re straight</li>
<li>You’re a democrat, or you’re a conservative</li>
<li>That’s terrorism, or that&rsquo;s a mental health problem</li>
<li>That place is dangerous, or it’s not</li>
<li>You’re a Christian, or you’re not</li>
<li>You’re racist, or you’re not</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution here, I’ve found, is to “taboo” the labels—stop talking about what things are classified as, and talk on a lower level of abstraction. If you sense people are getting hung up on the word “racist” (or predict that they will probably get hung up on the word “racist”), say what you <em>mean</em>, like “this policy mostly favours white people because X Y Z” Don’t whip out the dictionary and argue about whether it fits the definition of racist.</p>
<p>Seeing past classifications allows us see people and things as they actually are, rather than oversimplifying them or falsely judging their characteristics. Some useful heuristics here might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways is this example similar or different from this category?</li>
<li>Is this case better thought of as lying between two (or more) categories, rather than it lying in right in the middle of this one single category?</li>
<li>When this person labels this case with a category, but that label obviously seems inadequate, what are they actually intending to say about it? (Don’t get hung up on the label in that moment.)</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>
<p>One final, more general trick I&rsquo;d like to mention is an idea I&rsquo;ve adapted from reading about relationship counseling. I often internally use &ldquo;I statements&rdquo; such as &ldquo;I feel X is true&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;X is true&rdquo;. It distances me from identifying with ideas too strongly, and is an extra reminder to be humble—I’m a silly, fallible, ignorant and sometimes egoistic person. Anything that gets processed through my mind should be subject to suspicion as a matter of course. So long as that wariness doesn’t slip into general anxiety or insecurity (<em>ahem</em> because it’s not like wariness is simply good or simply bad), it’s is a tool I can use to be a better thinker and a better human being.</p>
