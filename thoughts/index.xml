      <title>Formalising Classification Schema</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m temporarily staying near a state park and have had a lot of opportunity to do my favourite thing&amp;ndash;extended walks in nature where I can go down deep holes Iâ€™d typically consider best left to rabbits with pocket watches. Today, my errant mind decided it was time to formalise and classify different types of nuance (because nothing is more nuanced than a formal classification schema).
I think that one of the most important skills for thinking fairly and accurately is considering nuance: resisting binary dichotomies on complex and important topics.</description>

      <description>(Just repaired my old laptop, and I&amp;rsquo;m going through my diary entries. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad they were recoverable. Here&amp;rsquo;s one of my (somewhat emotional) retrospectives that I had started a few months ago and finished just now.)
There was some thread online talking about &amp;ldquo;travel superpowers&amp;rdquo;, such as the ability to fall asleep easily in transit, to negotiate with pedlars, or to find cheap accommodation. My answer is something I inherited from my dad&amp;ndash;blithe fearlessness.</description>

      <description>There is a cruelty to the fairy godmothers, though they don&amp;rsquo;t mean it that way; there is an inhumanity to their love of lessons and surprise twists. If a man falls ill of a deadly sickness, his fairy godmother cannot simply alleviate his suffering and send him on his way. Oh, she has the power to just heal him, to be certain. She has the power to transform mice into horses, if she pleases.</description>

      <description>Had an exceptionally good day in Indore, topped by a conversation with a stand-up comedian named Div, who was curious about my perception of India. (I asked him if he had more than fifteen minutes for me to adequately respond to that, and he pointed out that, if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed, we were both sitting alone in a restaurant on a Friday night eating &amp;ldquo;fucking poha&amp;rdquo;.) At some point, I mentioned that on the way there, the auto driver had stopped and introduced me to two of his friends.</description>

      <title>Isaac&#39;s Checklist For Hard-Balling Autowallas...</title>

      <description>Isaac&amp;rsquo;s Checklist For Hard-Balling Autowallas That Start Out The Negotiation At 3.5x The Amount You Know It Actually Should Cost To Get To Your Destination:
1.) An amused smile and a &amp;ldquo;Baaaaaaaaapre.&amp;rdquo; The longer and more drawn out, the better&amp;ndash;this is a sign of virility in the Maratha culture. Men often sit in a circle and contest each other with how long they can draw out their &amp;ldquo;bapre&amp;quot;s. Having asserted your masculinity, offer the fair price times 1.</description>

      <title>Unwraveling the Indian Head Bobble</title>
      <link>https://www.isaacsamuel.github.io/blog/thoughts/head-bobble/</link>

      <description>After much time and study, I finally cracked the mystery of the Indian Head-Bobble.
All people with association to Indian culture will surely know about the Indian head-bobble. More common in the south than the north, it&amp;rsquo;s a curious side-to-side motion, something like shaking your head but around the x-axis. When it actually applies, however, is a mystery even few natives can explain.
When I came to India the first time, I first thought it was a somehow deferential way of saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m neither confirming nor denying your assumption&amp;rdquo;, because I saw a teenager use it instead of actually answering when questioned about his activities.</description>

      <title>Customer Service</title>

      <description>One of the many idiosyncrasies of India is its customer service.
On one hand, you have the infamous call centers that require 35 digit confirmation numbers (or God help you) and that can&amp;rsquo;t ever seem to use common sense if it requires going off-script. Banks where you literally have to negotiate to open a checking account, or who will send you to three different branches to avoid dealing with you. Thoroughly spiteful building managers who turn off the elevator when guests are over.</description>

      <title>Cultural Relations in the Bangalore P.G.: The Screenplay</title>
      <link>https://www.isaacsamuel.github.io/blog/thoughts/cultural-relations-pg/</link>

      <description>I recently moved into a P.G. (personal guest) here in Bangalore, a low-commitment and (in this case) dirt-cheap accommodation that provides food twice daily, perfect for migrant workers and students. My room is literally a bed in a hallway, so I spend a lot of time interacting with the people who live with me&amp;ndash;playing cards, discussing politics, and drinking whiskey of questionable legality.
Thus, I present a mostly accurate screenplay:</description>

      <description>(Today we got back our midterms in my computer science-oriented Probability and Statistics course. The TA told us the highest score was a 48 (out of fifty) and the lowest was in the tens but the average was somewhere in the thirties. The grade would be curved.
Computer science is a discipline full of chest-beating, maybe due to being skewed male and rife with impostor syndrome. One guy in particular is a good example&amp;ndash;he complained loudly about covering the material in India during his tenth grade year, he has a tendency to blurt out the answer preemptively when the professor is guiding the class on a problem, and he frequently laughs when other students ask a question he feels is obvious (and takes it on himself to explain the answer as condescendingly as humanly possible).</description>

      <title>A Five Minute Deconstruction of Free Will</title>
      <link>https://www.isaacsamuel.github.io/blog/thoughts/free-will/</link>

      <description>(This way-too-long, way-too-digressive response was written for a discussion about the nature of poverty and whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s a choice. There&amp;rsquo;s a much easier argument to be made that poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a choice in most cases without delving into the philosophical topic of free will, but I&amp;rsquo;m doing this for free, so this is what you get.)
There are a number of approaches you can take to dissolve the concept of free will, and/or the concept of personal responsibility.</description>

      <title>CSI: Applied Statistics</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a notion in my mind for a long time&amp;ndash;that the &amp;lsquo;unsexy&amp;rsquo; engineering jobs save more lives than firefighters and first-responders do, by building buildings, cars, and systems (including the equipment firefighters use) to be safe and functional. (So if you want to do something good for the world with you career, being a firefighter works, but keep in mind that people don&amp;rsquo;t celebrate the hard-working engineers whenever a bridge doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall down or when their cell works to call 911 in the first place.</description>

      <description>Thought experiment time!
Gina is an upper-middle-class woman who works as a professor in a university in inner-city Detroit. She idealistically started her kid in an inner-city school, because she believed the &amp;lsquo;white flight&amp;rsquo; from American cities was a big contributor to cycle of poverty. One day, her child comes home with a gash on her temple because she got in the way of some older kids fighting; a gang thing, the school administration tells her.</description>

      <description>Testing my friends hypothesis, &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t annoy me with talks about politics.&amp;rdquo; (In the tradition of trolling the other while they are lifting weights.)
TEST ONE: Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Gandhi did a creepy chastity experiment with his teenaged nieces.&amp;rdquo; Friend: &amp;ldquo;I know that.&amp;rdquo;
TEST TWO: Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Modi acted really suspiciously during the Gujarati riots.&amp;rdquo; Friend: Grunts non-commitadly
TEST THREE: Isaac: &amp;ldquo;The economic boom in India is due mainly to low oil prices, and the BJP is just taking credit for that without instituting the unpopular sweeping changes the economy really needs.</description>

      <title>Conversations With Missionaries</title>
      <link>https://www.isaacsamuel.github.io/blog/thoughts/missionaries/</link>

      <description>So today I sat down with a couple of missionaries (who often target me I think because I&amp;rsquo;m often alone and sitting outside, reading.) I generally enjoy such conversations, because missionaries are a friendly bunch and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent way more time than your average person thinking about religion.
But during such conversations, there are some cultural mistakes that happen with such regularity, and I feel like we spend most of the conversation correcting those rather than actually getting to the meat of anything.</description>
