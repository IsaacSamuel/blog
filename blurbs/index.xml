      <description>Isaac: &amp;ldquo;I know you&amp;rsquo;re joking around, but every time you hit me, I have an intense angry moment in which I have to choose not to hit you back much harder. Stop.&amp;rdquo; $FRIEND: &amp;ldquo;ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ You&amp;rsquo;d hit me, bro?&amp;rdquo; Isaac: &amp;ldquo;I have far too many siblings to believe in nonviolence.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Wearing masks have really focused my attention on the diversity, expressiveness, and beauty of eyes. I kind of get why artists and poets are so obsessed with them.
(However, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from experience that it&amp;rsquo;s typically an oddball thing to compliment strangers on. üòÇ I&amp;rsquo;m typically really free about saying &amp;ldquo;I love your hair!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Nice tattoo, man!&amp;rdquo; to random people. But complimenting people&amp;rsquo;s eyes usually comes across as flirting, or as being on drugs or something.</description>

Also Me: Spends an hour on the phone with his friend in India
Spends fourty-five minutes on the phone with his friend living three blocks away

      <description>Very random fun fact&amp;ndash;in India, it is customary for men to wear a second pair of underwear underneath their boxers. Which turns them into acceptable loungewear and marginally acceptable attire for a very casual motorcycle ride down to the market.</description>

      <description>Me: Oh, this really long elaborate GitHub issue I wrote two years ago is overcomplicating this. I can do a much simpler thing! Let me just do that.
Me: (spends time doing simple thing)
Me: WAIT AHHHHH
Me: NO THIS DOES NOT WORK WHY DID I NOT TRUST 2016 ME WHO OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT THIS THROUGH DAMN IT</description>

      <description>I was on an online forum discussing some of India&amp;rsquo;s greatest unsolved mysteries, and someone wrote &amp;ldquo;One of the unsolved mysteries is that someone stole my self esteem and I can&amp;rsquo;t get it back.&amp;rdquo; Until I read someone&amp;rsquo;s response (&amp;ldquo;Bhai Tinder uninstall kar do, self respect wapas aa jayegi&amp;rdquo;), I somehow parsed the poster as saying that his car (a Maruti Esteem) had been stolen.
I should have been tipped off by the idea that someone had stolen that model of car, if nothing else.</description>

      <description>Meeting my best friend Sashank for the first time in a year, and pretty darn ecstatic about it.
Isaac: hugs Sashank &amp;ldquo;Okay, one hug from me.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: hugs Sashank &amp;ldquo;Okay, one hug from Jayesh.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: hugs Sashank &amp;ldquo;Okay, one hug from Meg.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: hugs Sashank &amp;ldquo;Okay, one hug from Meg&amp;rsquo;s mom.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: &amp;ldquo;And my gram gives you the option of either a hug or her love, because she remembers from what I&amp;rsquo;ve described that you&amp;rsquo;re not prone to physical displays of affection and doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to quote &amp;lsquo;freak you out&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The eighth Harry Potter movie is showing on TV. Harry and Ron are frantically changing out of wet clothes after jumping into a lake
$Host_Sister: &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t they just change their clothes using magic?&amp;rdquo;
Isaac (aggrieved): &amp;ldquo;If Hanuman could grow so big he could fly a mountain from the Himalayas, why didn&amp;rsquo;t he just carry the army into Lanka instead of making everyone build a land bridge?&amp;rdquo;
Cue: Twenty-minute family argument, /w some yelling.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Arre, you bribed the ticket walla?!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No I didn&amp;rsquo;t! I tipped him&amp;hellip; and he gave me super special service in return. I mean, nobody was using these seats [in first class] and apparently they have the discretion to upgrade people.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;And you just paid him to use his discretion. That is called bribing.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Well, in America we call it tipping.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Brains work in, uh, mysterious ways. Today, I observed the weirdest instance of mine getting its &amp;ldquo;wires crossed&amp;rdquo;.
In lieu of change, a salesclerk gave me a couple pieces of expresso candy. My intention afterwards was to eat a piece of candy and simultaneously start a work task.
I sat down and popped the candy in my mouth, all according to plan. But suddenly, I felt a surge of alarm, convinced for a split-second that I had somehow eaten the task I was intending to complete.</description>

Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Oh, is it? Ek second, meh phone call lena zarurat hoon.&amp;rdquo; Mimes picking up the phone &amp;ldquo;Wow, call aap ke lie!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Am at the airport in Bangalore. On less than an hour sleep, I did what had to be the most stereotypically American-tourist thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done (and I feel no shame).
Worker: &amp;ldquo;Sir, what kind [of coffee] would you like?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Uhhhh, what are the options?&amp;rdquo;
Worker: &amp;ldquo;Sir, cappachino, americano, latte&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Do you have just like, regular coffee?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>On my daily commute home, I was carrying some rum to share for a birthday party in our P.G. After my bag went through the scanner at the metro station and I retrieved it, the female guard ran after me and indicated I needed to talk to the analyst about something he saw on the scanner.
Analyst: &amp;ldquo;Water bottle?&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Nei nei. Um&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Unzips bag to show contents)
Analyst (smiling as he examines the rum bottle): &amp;ldquo;Water bottle hai.</description>

      <description>Symptoms of faux maturity:
 Avoiding things you&amp;rsquo;d find fun because they are not what an &amp;ldquo;adult&amp;rdquo; does. (E.g. Dyeing your hair purple, playing video games.) Doing things you hate because they ARE what an &amp;ldquo;adult&amp;rdquo; does. (Buying a house, tending to a lawn, smoking, drinking coffee or alcohol.) Shaming or thinking less of people for doing harmless but weird or non-age-typical things. (Scoffing at someone for watching cartoons or putting M&amp;amp;Ms on their pizza.</description>

      <description>Isaac&amp;rsquo;s mandatory mental checklist whilst hanging out with his (majority desi / south asian) friends:
 Make an extremely convoluted conclusion about desi culture. What observations cause you to draw this conclusion? What assumptions are supporting the way you notice and interpret those actions? In what scenarios could those assumptions possibly be legitimate or illegitimate, and is that even a clearly defined boundary? Am I overthinking this? I‚Äôm overthinking this. This is not how a normal person hangs out with their friends.</description>

      <description>Isaac: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s completely possible to travel in India for less than $200 a month. You just have to be willing to give up all pretense of safety and comfort. Mostly, just be gregarious with people you meet in general and even on the street - they&amp;rsquo;ll invite you to stay with them, and your travels will totally be enriched.&amp;rdquo;
Boss (exasperated, horrified): &amp;ldquo;Isaac, where were your parents?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely the last thing on my priority list right now, but it occurred to me that it would be a lot of fun to make a Ramayana version of the Mario games where Mario is Rama, Sita is Peach, Donkey Kong is Hanuman, and Bowser is Ravana.</description>

Friend: &amp;ldquo;Isaac, you should ask one of us to watch of your bag while you&amp;rsquo;re climbing.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: &amp;ldquo;I feel pretty safe. Are you worried about something in particular?&amp;rdquo;
Friend: &amp;ldquo;Monkeys could get into it and mess with your stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that happen so many times.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: &amp;ldquo;Monkeys are less of a problem in the US.&amp;rdquo;

If any of you have full-time jobs, I suggest you take leave from them. This class is like labor camp.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac: smiles unwillingly
Isaac&amp;rsquo;s professor: looks at Isaac &amp;ldquo;I see you are laughing. But I am Russian. I know what labor camp is.

      <description>Despite rather badly wanting a dog, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure enough about my lifestyle in the next decade or even five years or so to actually take the leap and buy/adopt one. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve attached myself to two very affectionate local cats that belong to my neighbors, who allow them to walk outside freely most days.
I&amp;rsquo;ve talked briefly to the owners and gotten the cats&#39; names&amp;ndash;Mr. and Mrs. Bunny, and their adopted son Bunny Jr.</description>
