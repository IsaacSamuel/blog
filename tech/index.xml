      <description>I spent my childhood eternally frustrated by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley for their extreme lack of curiosity for the magical world. Dropped into the world&amp;rsquo;s premier magic prep school, their reaction was &amp;ldquo;mehhhhh, let&amp;rsquo;s cut class and play Quidditch.&amp;rdquo; Quidditch is awesome&amp;ndash;flying in general is awesome&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;m sure Hermione is missing out. But at least she is expressing what seems like the only sane reaction to discovering magic is real&amp;ndash;sheer wonder and excitement.</description>

      <description>A few days back I read this article about algorithmic bias.
Its argument as far as I can tell is as follows: When people complain about algorithms being biased (e.g. racially), they aren&amp;rsquo;t understanding how algorithms work. The algorithms are just performing statistics. These statistics are cold, hard math. The same statistics that reliably decide whether an email is spam or not spam, the same statistics that biologists use to study populations.</description>
