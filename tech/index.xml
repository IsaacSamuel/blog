      <description>A few days back I read this article about algorithmic bias. Its argument as far as I can tell is as follows: When people complain about algorithms being biased (e.g. racially), they aren&amp;rsquo;t understanding how algorithms work. The algorithms are just performing statistics. The same statistics that reliably decide whether an email is spam or not spam, the same statistics that biologists use to study populations. Race factually correlates with things like the probability of a criminal reoffending, and all the algorithms are doing is correctly calculating the probability that a given criminal is going to reoffend based on the available data.</description>
